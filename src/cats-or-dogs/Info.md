# Cat or Dog Classifier
This was the first model I made! I hope you enjoy :D

## Set up the dataset
First, extract /dataset/kagglecatsanddogs_5340.zip into /dataset/. Then, run process_dataset.py to organise the images into the folders "train" and "validation".

## Compile & train
Run main.py once the dataset has been set up. It should output the file cat_dog_classifier.h5 - I left the file of the trained model there just so that you can test it straight away

## Test with your own image
Provide the path of a jpeg image of a cat or a dog if you would like to try it yourself!
